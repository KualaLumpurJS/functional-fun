# Functional Fun! (A KLJS Workshop)

## Setup

1. Find a suitable local directory and clone this project. `git clone https://github.com/kualalumpurjs/functional-fun`
1. Ensure that you have npm (Node) installed. [If not, download it.](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Run `npm install` in your project directory.

## Running tests

1. Run `npm test` to run the tests.

## What to do

1. Find a partner
1. Sit down at the computer together
1. One of you "drives", i.e. controls the computer. The other
"copilots", i.e. watch everything you do, ensuring it is done correctly. (Pair Programming)
1. Take turns to switch roles after each session.
1. Write the code to make the tests pass. Try not to skip as the tests are written in some logical order. Reuse earlier functions in later code.
1. There may be bugs in the test code. That is part of the challenge :P

## Need help?

1. Give me a shout!
1. Solutions will be posted in the FB group after the meetup.
